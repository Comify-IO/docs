To integrate Comify into your application, you'll first need to create a Comify account and set up a service provider in the Comify Dashboard. Follow these steps to get started:

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Comify Account">
    [Create a Comify account](https://www.comify.io/sign-up) on Comify or [Sign In](https://app.comify.io/login) if you already have one.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the SDK into your project">
    Choose the product that best suits your use case and follow the SDK installation instructions:

    - [Communication](/communication/overview)
    - [PubSub](/pubsub/overview)
    - [Messaging](/messaging/overview)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure API Keys">
    To access Comify, set the `COMIFY_API_KEY` in your environment variables. You can find your API key in the developer section of your Comify dashboard.

    For security reasons, it’s best to store your API key as an environment variable.

    ```bash
    COMIFY_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Your Service Provider">
    In order to send communications, you’ll need to add a service provider. Follow the instructions for your service provider of choice

    - [Whatsapp](/service-provider/whatsapp)
    - [Email](/service-provider/email)
    - [SMS](/service-provider/sms)
    - [Push](/service-provider/push)
  </Step>

</Steps>
