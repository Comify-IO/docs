title: What is Comify?
description: ""
---

Comify is an omnichannel communication infrastructure platform that greatly reduces the effort and complexity required to implement notifications your users will love, all without the need to build your own notification system.

We designed Comify with both developers and product teams in mind: itâ€™s easy for developers to implement quickly, and simple for less-technical users to interact with and maintain content with a powerful intuitive dashboard.

Comify functions as an abstraction layer between your application and end users, and manages all aspects of notification workflow logic and delivery provider management.

### How does it work?

Managing notifications across multiple channels is painful. Each notification delivery provider has their own SDK, authentication methods, and API quirks. This complexity dramatically increases as you add additional logic such as delays, digests/batches, or multi-tiered notification approaches.

Comify abstracts away these complexities, and allows you to focus on building great user experiences while keeping your codebase simple and maintainable.
